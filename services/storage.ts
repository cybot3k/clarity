/**
 * The app's one persistent key-value store, backed by MMKV.
 *
 * MMKV is memory-mapped and synchronous, which is a hard requirement here rather
 * than a preference: `lib/passage-catalog.ts` resolves content ids outside React
 * during the first render, and both stores feed `useSyncExternalStore`, whose
 * `getSnapshot` must be synchronous. An async store would force a gate into boot.
 *
 * This module is the ONLY place that touches `react-native-mmkv`. Everything
 * above it talks to the `KvBackend` interface in `lib/history-store.ts`, so the
 * store logic — including migration and quarantine, the riskiest parts — is
 * testable under bun against an in-memory backend.
